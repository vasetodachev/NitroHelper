NitroHelper extension for Chrome.

This extension provides two functionalities that will help with your everyday troubleshooting and working with clients.

1. Start PSI test for the current URL you are on, in a new tab.
2. Open new tab with automatically added "?nonitro", so you can compare optimized and unoptimized versions of the page.
3. Run Demo optimization test similar to the one that could be performed on https://nitropack.io/
4. Check if page is Mobile Friendly, as you would do on https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly/
5. Add random ?testnitro= parameter at the end of the URL. This way you can easily test if the new settings will resolve the issue without the need for clearing the old cache, which may also reflect with bigger issue on live page.
6. Check if the page supports Rich Results. as you would do on https://search.google.com/test/rich-results/
7. Check the Source Code of the page you are currently on.


Installation guide can be found in:
NitroHelper_installation_guide.pdf


IMPORTANT:
Please note that since this is not official extension release and it cannot be found in the Market - YOU WILL HAVE TO KEEP THE FILES ON YOUR LOCAL DEVICE. If you want it to work ofcourse! :)
